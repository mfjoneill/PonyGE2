cache = {}
# This dict stores the cache for an evolutionary run. The key for each entry
# is the phenotype of the individual, the value is its fitness.

best_fitness_list = []
# fitness_plot is simply a list of the best fitnesses at each generation.
# Useful for plotting evolutionary progress.

time_list = []
# time_list stores the system time after each generation has been completed.
# Useful for keeping track of how long each generation takes.

stats_list = []
# List for storing stats at each generation
# Used when verbose mode is off to speed up program

fitness_entropy_list = []
#  useful for plotting entropy of fitness of population over time
